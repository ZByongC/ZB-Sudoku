## Sudoku Goals 
The goal is to fill out the grid with numbers following some simple rules.

## Rules
1. What you have is a nine by nine grid of numbers
2. numbers split out into nine three by three squares.
3. Each row, each column, and each three by three square must contain all numbers between one through nine.
4. What that amounts to is you can't have the same number twice in any given row, column or three by three square.
